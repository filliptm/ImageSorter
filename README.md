# ImageSorter
This little app allows you to load up a directory of images and quickly select the ones you want and submit the changes. When submitted it will move those "Good" images in a dedicated folder of your choosing, and move the remaining displayed images to a secondary "BAD" folder. Allowing for quick, manual evaluation of mass amounts of images
